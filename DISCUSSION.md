TODO: The following are the things that I want to do to improve the table.

-  Inestiage using FTS for searching advocates
-  Implement a cache using React Query
-  Upgrade to Next.js 15 to avoid issues with unwanted caching
-  Add better loading state to the table
-  Add pagination to the table and API
-  Add sorting to the table and API
-  Add clickable support for specialties
-  Add a query string support to the page to support refresh of the page with the same search term
-  Add prettier formatting for the project
-  Investigate using a different approach for specialty filtering so that it is distinct from the text search. Possibly using a tag field
